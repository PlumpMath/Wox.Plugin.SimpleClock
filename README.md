# Wox.Plugin.SimpleClock
A simple clock plugin for [Wox](https://www.getwox.com/)

Currently it does the following:
- Allows you to set/edit/delete alarms
- Sounds the alarm from an mp3 file (2 audio tracks are provided) set in the settings window of Wox
- Allows you to control a stopwatch

This plugin is not yet uploaded to Wox/Plugins, but will be in a couple of days when code is sorted out completely.
