A simple clock plugin for [Wox](https://www.getwox.com/)

![Simple Clock](http://i.imgur.com/K7BgfQ2.gif)

Uses NAudio to play audio files.

Currently it does the following:
- Allows you to set/edit/delete alarms
- Sounds the alarm from an mp3 file (2 audio tracks are provided) set in the settings window of Wox
- Allows you to control a stopwatch

This plugin is not yet uploaded to Wox/Plugins.

TODOs:
- Test with various file formats. Mp3 and Wav are not enough.
